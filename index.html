    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application now features a "Home Page" as its initial view, presenting a grid of buttons. Each button represents a distinct quiz set, dynamically generated from a central data structure. Clicking a button transitions to the "Quiz Container" view, which maintains the single-question-at-a-time focus, progress tracking, and immediate feedback. Upon quiz completion, the "Results Container" is shown. Navigation between these views is handled via dedicated buttons (e.g., "Back to Home", "Restart Quiz"). This structure provides a clear entry point for users to select their desired quiz content and enhances the application's scalability for future quiz additions. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The Home Page uses a simple grid of styled HTML buttons to allow selection of quiz sets (Goal: Organize/Navigate, Interaction: Click). Questions are presented as text with clickable buttons for options (Goal: Test Knowledge, Interaction: Click). Feedback is a dynamic text block (Goal: Inform, Interaction: Appears on click). Final score is visualized with a Chart.js Donut Chart (Goal: Compare/Summarize, Viz: Donut Chart) showing correct vs. incorrect answers for a quick, impactful summary of performance. All diagrams/visuals are HTML/CSS/Canvas based, adhering to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
